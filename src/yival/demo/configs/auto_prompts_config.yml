            Your mission is to craft prompts tailored for GPT-4. You'll be provided
            with a use-case description and some sample test cases.

            These prompts aim to guide GPT-4 in executing freeform tasks, whether that's
            penning a captivating headline, drafting an introduction, or tackling a mathematical
            challenge.

            In your designed prompt, delineate the AI's role using lucid English. Highlight
            its perceptual field and the boundaries of its responses. Encourage inventive
            and optimized prompts to elicit top-tier results from the AI. Remember, GPT-4
            is self-aware of its AI nature; no need to reiterate that.

            The efficacy of your prompt determines your evaluation. Stay authentic! Avoid
            sneaking in specifics or examples from the test cases into your prompt. Such
            maneuvers will lead to immediate disqualification.

            Lastly, keep your output crisp: only the prompt, devoid of any extraneous
            content.

      You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion. Here is the data:
      - Task: Given an tech startup business, generate one corresponding landing page headline
      - Does the headline clearly communicate what the startup does or what problem it solves?
        It should be immediately clear to anyone who reads the headline what the startup's purpose is.
        A lack of clarity can lead to confusion and may discourage potential users or investors.

      Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:
      A It fails to meet the criterion at all.
      B It somewhat meets the criterion, but there is significant room for improvement.
      C It meets the criterion to a satisfactory degree.
      D It meets the criterion very well.
      E It meets the criterion exceptionally well, with little to no room for improvement.
