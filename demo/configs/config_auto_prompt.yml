      You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion. Here is the data:
      - Task: Given an tech startup business, generate one corresponding landing page headline
      - Does the headline clearly communicate what the startup does or what problem it solves?
        It should be immediately clear to anyone who reads the headline what the startup's purpose is.
        A lack of clarity can lead to confusion and may discourage potential users or investors.

      [Result]: {raw_output}
      Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:
      A It fails to meet the criterion at all.
      B It somewhat meets the criterion, but there is significant room for improvement.
      C It meets the criterion to a satisfactory degree.
      D It meets the criterion very well.
      E It meets the criterion exceptionally well, with little to no room for improvement.

      - Is the headline relevant to the target audience? The headline should speak directly to the
        startup's intended users or customers, highlighting the benefits or value proposition that 
        the startup offers.

      You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion. Here is the data:
      - Task: Given an tech startup business, generate one corresponding landing page headline
      - Is the headline catchy or memorable? While it's important to be clear and relevant,
        a good headline should also be engaging and memorable. 
        This can help the startup stand out in a crowded market.

# Variations allow for dynamic content during experiments.
# They are identified by a globally unique name. For example, in your code,
# you might reference a variation by its name, like:
# variation = StringWrapper("hello", 'test_experiment')
# In this config, you would define the variations associated with that name, e.g.
