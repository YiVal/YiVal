        "- When generating article summaries, it is challenging to make them contain a reasonable amount of information. A good summary should be detailed and entity-centred, rather than entity-dense and difficult to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "- CoD is a nifty technique originally designed to craft increasingly concise, yet information-rich summaries from a given content. It identifies a set of unique and salient entities in the source text at a fixed number of iteration rounds and fuses them into the previous summary without increasing the text length. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "  CoD operates in a two-step cycle, repeated five times:\n",
        "  - Think of it as a detective, first identifying 1-3 key pieces of information - or 'entities' - from the article that are absent from the existing summary.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Then, like a skilled writer, it crafts a new, denser summary. This new summary is no longer than the previous one, yet it cleverly incorporates all previous details plus the newly identified entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- CoD follows a set of guidelines to ensure the summaries are not just dense, but also stand-alone. It's like a mini masterclass in writing - promoting the use of fusion, compression, and the removal of uninformative phrases to make room for additional entities. And, it never forgets - entities from the previous summary are always retained.\n",
